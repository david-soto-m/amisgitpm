However, I have published this crate. My reasons are:

1. I wanted to know what I had installed from git in some form or other.
1. I wanted to use latest versions of software with updates.
1. I wanted to have some assistance with the build process.
1. I wanted if possible to automatically rebuild and install the latest updates.
1. I wanted to uninstall the software.
1. I wanted to be able to always go back at least on version
